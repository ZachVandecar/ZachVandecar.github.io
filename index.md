### Welcome

I'm Zach Vandecar, and I recently graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with a computer science and mathematics double major! While at SNHU, I got to practice full stack development with a team using the Agile methodology. In other classes I got to apply machine learning techniques to real world data. While learning data science in Rstudio, I enjoyed making connections to linear algebra and calculus concepts. I also got a minor in philosophy because I enjoy the topics. I enjoyed writing persuasive philosophical papers and getting to participate in discussions about philosophical topics.
